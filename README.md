# 3alimnIA V6.0.1 — Global AI Academy

3alimnIA is a multilingual generative-AI learning platform for difficult concepts, beginning with Quantum Computing and Qiskit.

V6 redesigns the public experience after benchmarking Edraak, Brilliant, IBM Quantum Learning, and DataCamp, while preserving the platform's research and pedagogical differentiators:

- learner-first attempts before AI assistance;
- visual and practice-based learning;
- a constrained AI Coach;
- a controlled Concept Builder for educational materials;
- LPQS evaluation of AI responses;
- learner analytics and anonymized research export.

## V6.0.1 production UI hotfix

- Professional public header with working native Streamlit callbacks.
- Hidden native navigation registration instead of the visible collapsed menu.
- Cloud-safe official logo rendering through `st.image`.
- Compact hero optimized for 1366×768 and multilingual typography.
- Static validation: `python validate_v601_production_ui.py`.

## Main experiences

### Public platform

- Home
- Programs and learning paths
- Generative AI Studio
- Universities and research
- Learner access
- Evaluator access

### Learner workspace

- Research notice and consent
- Pre-test and adaptive plan
- Six Qiskit learning modules
- AI Tutor Lab and Concept Builder
- Post-test and satisfaction survey
- Progress and completion evidence

### Evaluator and research workspace

- Study protocol
- Participant and registration management
- Learner details
- AI interaction logs
- LPQS response evaluation
- Learning analytics
- Anonymized and administrative exports

## Languages

- العربية — full RTL interface and localized learning content
- Français
- English

Qiskit code, Python syntax, and necessary technical identifiers remain in English.

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Streamlit Cloud

- Main file: `app.py`
- Python dependencies: `requirements.txt`
- Copy `.streamlit/secrets_example.toml` into Streamlit Cloud Secrets and replace placeholder values.
- Do not commit `.streamlit/secrets.toml`, `.env`, or local database files.

## Validation

```bash
python validate_v6_global_academy.py
python -m py_compile app.py ui_v6.py config.py main_app.py router.py
```

Expected result:

```text
V6 global AI academy validation passed.
```

## V6 design files

- `ui_v6.py` — public pages and reusable V6 components
- `.streamlit/v6_theme.css` — V6 visual system and responsive rules
- `V6_GLOBAL_BENCHMARK_AND_REDESIGN_AR.md` — benchmark and design rationale
- `assets/branding/v6_global_academy_preview.html` — static design preview

## Data safety

V6 does not intentionally modify database schemas, participant records, test data, LPQS ratings, AI interaction logs, or research exports. Back up the current database before deployment.
